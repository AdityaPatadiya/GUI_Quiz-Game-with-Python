# GUI_Quiz-Game-with-Python
This is the GUI-based Python Quiz Game made with *tkinter* python package.
This package is used to create UI for users.
It is a T/F Quiz game.

## How it's work?
Here, you have to run main.py file to play this game. This will open a dialog box, In which the question will display and based on the buttons, we have to decide that the answer is True or False.

## How to get the Data?
In this project, I used the opentdb(https://opentdb.com/api_config.php) api to get the data according to my preference.
I used
-Number of Questions: 10
-Select Category: Science Computers
-Select Difficulty: Any Diffculty
-Select Difficulty: True/False
-Select Encoding: Default Encoding (You can try other encoding type to get the api link.)

It is easy to get the data instead to typing manually in different file.
you add the things according to your preference and pass as parameters in *data.py* file.

## Here's how the project is looks like:-
